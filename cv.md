## About me
Graduated as an interpreter from/to Chinese I worked several years at international trade company. Business trips and life on-the-go made me flexible and adaptive to fast-changing environment. It was a great place to become a fast learner - new people, cities and projects stepped one after another.
After Covid outbreak I returned to my homecity and lived a tranquil life of a self-employed tour-guide until I faced a necessity of relocation. So now I work hard to make the skills list below look more content.
## Skills

    if (randomElement.text.length > 35) {

    } else {
      advice.style.fontSize = '30px';
    }
});
